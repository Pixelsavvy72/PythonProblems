# PythonProblems

This is collection of Python code I've written in the past. I haven't worked with Python for a while and I want to go back through what I've done and refresh my memory. Some of this is from the MIT Computer Science course I completed, others are problems I found online and wanted to have a go at, and a bit here and there is just for fun. It's probably not too clean, as I began my programming career in Python before switching primarily to ASP.NET, and so this shows more of an initial attempt at understanding the code.
